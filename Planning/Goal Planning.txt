Patrol Home Base/Flag
Add in team mate enemy spotting. EX: team mate sees enemy, sends message to others of their position at that time.

 - Random Wander within a fixed distance of the flag

$Evaluate it based on team mates location to the flag and last known enemy position in relation to flag. Own character bias etc.
