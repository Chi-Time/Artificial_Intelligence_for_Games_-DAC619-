Instead of using setscore to determine if flag is not in base. Maybe instead make it so that we check if our team's flag is within a fixed distance of our base.

Implement messaging so that the AI can add sub states to itself as it needs them if it's still in a comp_goal. Example: AI is taking flag home, needs health, adds health sub state to itself. Heals up, returns to previous task.

If we're in a location, don't pick in the search goal.

Make it so that AI can see flag when other person is carrying it.

We will half evaluator of teammates and enemies so that they don't factor as heavily into the main evaluation equations. For Example: Enemies number is divided by 2 so that it's not as big a factor.


Figure out how to add sub states through messages
EX: Wants to call for help adds substate call for help to current composite

Don't let AI go backwards from base to get health.

C_Goal GetFlag
 - A_Goal FindFlag
 - A_Goal CollectFlag

C_Goal ReturnFlag
 - A_Goal ReturnToBase
  - Check if hurt enough to signal team.
  - OR: Check to see if message has come in for new sub state.
 - A_Goal ScoreFlag

C_Goal GetFlagFromEnemy
 - A_Goal AttackEnemy
 - A_Goal CollectFlag

C_Goal DefendFlagBearer
 - A_Goal MoveTowardTeammate
 - A_Goal AttackEnemy

A_Goal ReturnToBase
 - Tell the AI to Head Home

A_Goal FindFlag
 - Check if team already has flag
  - If they do quit
 - Check if teammate recently died with flag
  - Head to teammate position
 - Head toward enemy base

A_Goal ScoreFlag
 - Use the flag on the home base

A_Goal AttackEnemy
 - Check if enemy is in view
 - Fight them 
 - If they're dead
  - Action Completed

A_Goal SignalFlagSwap
 - Inform Team that you want to swap flag

A_Goal ReturnFlagSwapSignal
 - Inform teammate who asked your response

A_Goal CollectFlag
 - If flag is in sight
 - Pick it up
  - If not close enough
  - Keep moving toward it.

A_Goal GiveFlagToTeamate
 - When teammate is in sight and is close enough
 - Drop Flag
 - Signal teammate that flag has been dropped.

A_Goal MoveTowardTeammate
 - Moves toward the teammate specified.

A_Goal Flee
 - Retreat

AI gives health kit to teammate who needs it.

Flanking Behaviour - Cool idea probably not likely

Camp Enemy Spawn/Location

Patrol Home Base/Flag
Add in team mate enemy spotting. EX: team mate sees enemy, sends message to others of their position at that time.

A_Goal GuardFlag
 - Random Wander within a fixed distance of the flag

$Evaluate it based on team mates location to the flag and last known enemy position in relation to flag. Own character bias etc.
